â€¢ Scripts to help admins run events, namely:
[ ] Move all players to me within custom radius
[ ] Set all players gear to my gear (as long as I'm not in admin suit)
[ ] Teleport all downed players within custom radius to me 
[ ] Spawn different unarmed helis in a circle on the salt flats
[ ] Delete all event vehicles within a 5km radius (you'll use setVariable ["RR_EventVehicle",true,true] on all the vehicles when spawning)
[ ] Any more you can think of
