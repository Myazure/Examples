**HELLO AND WELCOME TO THE FIRST MICHAEL REEVES REVERSE ENGINERRING CHALLANGE**
We decided to start off simple, see how yall'd get along with it.

CTF:

We have discoved an acient (but still x86 lol) excecutable file, and the key to all our doors is in it :((((
We managed to recover a regular experssion that the key must match with, it isnt much. but it should help, it's `/ctf\{.*\}/`;


Winners will be awareded a special role :))
(on completeion pm the flag to @ben)
